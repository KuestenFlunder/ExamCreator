# Exam Desktop Application

## Introduction

Welcome to the Exam Desktop Application project, the first milestone in Team Kuestenflunder's journey into the software development landscape. Embarking on our inaugural private collaboration, we have endeavored to craft a single software that not only harmonizes the process of creating and managing a pool of questions but also transcends traditional boundaries by facilitating the seamless creation of randomized exams from the existing question repository. Utilizing JSON through the Jackson Library, we have paved a solid path towards backend development, laying a robust foundation for potential future enhancements.

## Features 

Explore the intricate functionalities that set our application apart, fostering a blend of innovation and efficiency:

- **Question Creation & Management**: Forge a rich and versatile question repository with our application. It allows for the creation and management of a varied pool of questions, offering an enriched resource hub for various complexities and subjects.

- **Dynamic Exam Creation**: Experience the innovation behind our intelligent algorithm that empowers users to create randomized exams from the established question pool. This feature promises a unique and unanticipated exam experience with each iteration, encouraging a comprehensive evaluation process.

- **Automated Exam Evaluation**: Dive into the convenience offered by our automated evaluation system. This feature not only accelerates the grading process but also guarantees accuracy and consistency, thereby streamlining the overall evaluation workflow.

- **Alert System**: Navigate with ease through our application, equipped with a dynamic alert system. This system ensures that users are continuously updated about various events and discrepancies, fostering a user-centric and friendly environment.

## Tech Stack 

Our application is crafted with the assistance of a modern and efficient technology stack, promising reliability and scalability:

- **JavaFX**: Our chosen GUI library, enabling the development of a rich and interactive user interface, enhancing user experience.
- **Jackson Library**: Integrated for proficient handling of JSON, thereby establishing a potent backend infrastructure that promises future scalability and enhancements.
- **Google Guice**: Incorporated for seamless dependency injection, promoting a modular and unified codebase that stands as a testimony to modern software engineering principles.
